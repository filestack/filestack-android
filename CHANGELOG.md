Change Log
==========
Version 5.2.0 *(2018-10-15)*
----------------------------

 * [Feature] SDK now contains `consumer-proguard-rules.pro` file which should automatically resolve any issues with ProGuard. Please, see the **tester** module to see an example implementation.
 * [Feature] **Tester** module allows to choose between single and multi file picking
 * [Change] Cloud authentication is now based on `Chrome Custom Tabs`
 * [Change] Removed an access to some of the flags that should be only used internally
 * [Change] `ConstraintLayout` is no longer a dependency
 * [Change] All SDK's resources are now prefixed with `filestack__`. This is in order to avoid using them unintentionally.
 * **Minimum supported API level is now 16** (previously it was 19). Keep in mind that a default system file picker has been introduced in API 19 (KitKat), so you need to verify that there is an app on user's system that can handle `ACTION_GET_CONTENT` intent.
 * Java SDK has been updated to the recent version (`0.9.0`).

Version 5.1.0 *(2018-09-27)*
----------------------------

 * [Feature] Single file choice can now be enforced with `FsConstants.EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE_FILES` flag. This flag defaults to **true** which means that without setting it to false, a user can choose multiple files to upload.
 * [UI change] Source name (like Dropbox/Facebook) is now displayed in Action Bar.
 * [UI fix] Checkmarks of selected files are now properly tinted. 
 * Java SDK has been updated to the recent version (`0.8.2`).

Version 5.0.0-0.3.0 *(2018-05-21)*
----------------------------

  * Updated Java SDK to v0.7.0 which includes a fix for storage options being ignored
  * Added option to restrict file MIME types that can be uploaded
  * Updated demo application with in-app config and logging

Version 5.0.0-0.2.0 *(2018-03-19)*
----------------------------

### Bug Fixes
  * Fixes a crash that would occur when a user selected a file from the local device browser, after
    they had previously viewed a cloud source

Version 5.0.0-0.1.0 *(2018-01-18)*
----------------------------

### Notes
  * Using filestack-java v0.6.0
  * **Corrected version naming to 5.0.0-0.1.0 as 2.0.0-alpha.x was obviously
    wrong**
  * We're still appending a pre-release (0.1.0) identifier because the public
    interface may change somewhat, but we consider it usable, reasonably stable

### Breaking Changes
  * Selection class implements Parcelable interface instead of Serializable
  * As such the method used to retrieve selections from intents has changed
  * Selection instances may have a null path (because uri is set instead)
  * Selection instances may have a null uri (because path is set instead)
  * Several classes have been moved to the internal package
  * Anything inside the internal package should not be considered public API

### Bug Fixes
  * A notification is displayed at the beginning of a local upload, instead of
    the completion
  * A notification is displayed for failed uploads

### New Features
  * Select local files using the Storage Access Framework (Files app UI)
  * Expanded local file support, upload anything, not just photos and videos

Version 2.0.0-alpha.2 *(2017-11-20)*
----------------------------

  * New options and several bug fixes
  * FS-2208 Fix upload button, auth flow refresh, and local upload crash
    * Fix: Upload button not showing when it should on initial launch and in
      other circumstances
    * Fix: UI not refreshing after returning from auth flow
    * Fix: Crash when trying to upload multiple local items
    * Fix: Notifications not showing on Android Oreo
  * FS-2144 Save UI state on rotate
    * Fix: Various confusing losses of state and unnecessary data loading that
      occurred when the device was rotated.
    * Fix: Divider spacing in grid view mode
  * FS-2142 Customize which sources are enabled and shown
    * New: You can now pass an option that specifies which sources are shown in
      the nav drawer. If the option is omitted, a default set is used.
  * FS-1970 Select files without automatically uploading
    * New: You can now pass an option that prevents the picker from uploading
      files automatically. This way an integrating app can have more control
      over what and how files are uploaded. The Client class from the base java
      SDK can be used to perform the uploads manually.
